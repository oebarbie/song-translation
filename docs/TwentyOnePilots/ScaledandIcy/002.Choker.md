**_I don't bother anyone  
Nervous when I stand  
Chokin' on the circumstance  
Only smokin' secondhand (Mm-mm)  
Cut us open, spread us out (Mm-mm)  
Dry us in the sand (Mm-mm)  
Lay the fibers side by side (Mm-mm)  
And you'll begin to understand (Mm-mm)_**  

**_I know it's over  
I was born a choker  
Nobody's comin' for me  
Comin' for me_**  

**_I don't bother anyone  
Never make demands  
Chokin' on the circumstance  
Self-sabotage is a sweet romance (Mm-mm)  
Seems like all I'm worth is what I'm able to withstand (Mm-mm)  
Sooner I can realize that pain is just a middleman_**  

**_I know it's over  
I was born a choker  
Nobody's comin' for me_**  

**_I see no volunteers to co-sign on my fears  
I'll sign on the line  
Alone, I'm gonna change my circumstance  
I know I need to move right now_**  

**_'Cause I know it's over  
I was born a choker  
Nobody's comin' for me (Only smokin' secondhand)  
I know it's over  
I was born a choker  
Nobody's comin' for me  
Comin' for me_**  

**_Like a little splinter buried in your skin  
Someone else can carve it out but when you've got the pin  
It hurts a little less and you can even push it further in  
When your body's screamin' out, trust your mind's listenin'  
Like a silhouette that you can barely see  
As a shadow cast upon the ground where you'll eventually  
Lay forever, but the day goes on, the sun moves behind you  
You get taller, bolder, stronger, and the rearview only blinds you_**
