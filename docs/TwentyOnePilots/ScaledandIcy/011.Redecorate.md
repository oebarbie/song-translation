----------------------------------------

**_There was a wonderful structure to the city  
And it put my cares to rest  
Ooh-ooh-ooh  
Ooh-ooh-ooh_**  

**_Takin' inventory of his life  
Seein' snapshots chronologically in line  
Something told him he should look around and tidy up  
He collected many things but never quite enough  
Tried lookin' at it from a new perspective  
Flat on his back but he still heard the directive  
Orders from that corner where that shadow always lived  
Never asked permission, he just hopes that they forgive_**  

**_I don't want to go like this (Ooh-ooh-ooh)  
At least let me clean my room  
I don't want to leave like this (Ooh-ooh-ooh)  
'Cause the last thing I want to do is  
Make my people make decisions, wonderin' what to do, oh  
Should they keep it on display  
Or redecorate?_**  

**_Blankets over mirrors, she tends to like it  
She's not afraid of her reflection  
But of what she might see behind it  
She had plans to change her name, yeah  
Just not the traditional way, yeah    
Haunted by a couple big mistakes  
She covers all the dents with the way she decorates  
Then one night, she got cold with no blankets on her bed  
So she ripped them off the mirror, stepped back and she said_**  

**_I don't want to go like this (Ooh-ooh-ooh)  
At least let me clean my room  
I don't want to leave like this (Ooh-ooh-ooh)  
'Cause the last thing I want to do is  
Make my people make decisions, wonderin' what to do, oh  
Should they keep it on display  
Or redecorate?_**  

**_With the bells and the whistles scaled back  
Like an isolated track  
And he feels trapped when he's not inebriated  
Fair to say he's fairly sedated most days of the week  
He might have made it if he lived on a different street  
I repeat, scaled back and isolated  
He says he likes an open schedule, but he mostly hates it  
If you're running to his room, take a breath before you break in  
Put your ear up to the door, tell me, can you hear him saying?_**  

**_I don't want to go like this  
At least let me clean my room  
I don't want to leave like this  
'Cause the last thing I want to do is  
Make my people make decisions, wondering what to do, oh  
Should they keep it on display  
Or redecorate?  
I don't want to go like this (Go like this)  
At least let me clean my room (Clean my room)  
I don't want to leave like this (Leave like this)  
'Cause the last thing I want to do is (To do is)  
Make my people make decisions, wondering what to do, oh  
Should they keep it on display (On display)  
Or redecorate?_**
